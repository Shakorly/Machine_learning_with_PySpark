# Machine_learning_with_PySpark

This project demonstrates how to perform machine learning tasks using PySpark's MLlib library.
It shows how to use a SparkSession to work with large datasets stored in DataFrames, 
build machine learning Pipelines by combining Estimators (which learn models from data) and
Transformers (which apply transformations or models), all designed to run efficiently across distributed systems
